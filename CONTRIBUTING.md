## Installation

NoteX is a Next.js app. To run it locally, you need to have Node.js installed.

> NoteX uses Firebase for authentication and database. You need to create a Firebase project and add the credentials to a `.env.local` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notexdotlive/notex.git
```

or if you use SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:notexdotlive/notex.git
```

Then, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pnpm id
```

> We use `pnpm` as the package manager. You can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
