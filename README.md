## Introduction

NoteX is a open source note taking app. It's a simple, fast and secure way to take notes.

It's designed to be a replacement for the Notes app on your phone or computer, but with more features and without the limitations of the default applications.

No one likes to lose their notes, so we made NoteX to be as reliable as possible. NoteX works offline, so you can take notes even if you don't have an internet connection. Your notes will be saved locally, so you don't have to worry about losing your notes.

**Ready to start taking notes? Open [NoteX](https://notex.live) and start writing.**
